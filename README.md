Joystick Adapter for Acorn Archimedes Computers
===============================================

KiCad project for an Archimedes joysticker adapter. Derived from an initial design by **Ian Haylock** that plugs externally into the computers parallel port and enables two Atari style joystickers to be plugged in. Software must be installed to recognize the adapter. Full details and pictures can be found in this Stardot Forum [thread](). See release folder for latest version, currently v0.2 along with a BOM file.
