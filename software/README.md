=============

Orginal **ArcWeld Joystick Adapter** schematic in !Draw format and driver Modules from Ian Haylock. This software and circuit design only seemes to exist [here](http://legacy.huber-net.de/Joystick.zip) and is only referenced [here](https://forums.jaspp.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3092#p3092). Unzip this on an Acorn Archimedes using apps such as !SparkFS. It is replicated here just in case that site disappears. Source code for the modules has not been found, though it maybe possible to use !ModDis to disassemble.
